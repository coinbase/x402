# @x402/solana

## TODO

The `@x402/solana` package defines the Solana implementations of various **x402 schemes**, starting with **exact**.

It provides three core exports:
- A subclass of `SchemeNetworkClient`
- A subclass of `SchemeNetworkFacilitator`
- A subclass of `SchemeNetworkResourceService`

As this package existed in v1, it also includes legacy exports under `/v1` for backward compatibility.

**Tip** Follow `@x402/evm` as a reference.
