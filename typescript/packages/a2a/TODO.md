# @x402/a2a

## TODO

The `@x402/a2a` package implements **x402 payment flows over the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**, enabling interoperable payments between agents across different transports and ecosystems.

It builds on the `x402Client`, `x402Server`, and `x402Facilitator` abstractions, adapting them for A2A messaging and discovery patterns.

This implementation allows x402-enabled agents to advertise, request, and settle payments as part of standard A2A communication flows.

---

**Note:** The official A2A implementation currently exists in a separate repository.  
The long-term goal is to **merge it into this repository** for unified development, testing, and release management.
