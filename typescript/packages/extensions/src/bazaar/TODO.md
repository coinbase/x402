# @x402/extensions/bazaar

## TODO

So far we've just outlined a function to build the `bazaar` extensions declaration.

This may be sufficient, but as we actually integrate some test servers that use the extension, we may learn of more requirements.

We also need to consider how discovery could look for A2A or MCP.
