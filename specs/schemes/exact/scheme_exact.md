# Scheme: `exact`

## Summary

`exact` is a scheme that transfers a specific amount of funds from a client to a resource server. The resource server must know in advance the exact
amount of funds they need to be transferred.

## Example Use Cases

- Paying to view an article
- Purchasing digital credits
- An LLM paying to use a tool

## Critical Validation Requirements

While implementation details vary by network, facilitators MUST enforce security constraints that prevent sponsorship abuse. Examples include:

### SVM

- Fee payer safety: the fee payer MUST NOT appear as an account in sensitive instructions or be the transfer authority/source.
- Destination correctness: the receiver MUST match the `payTo` derived destination for the specified `asset`.
- Amount exactness: the transferred amount MUST equal `maxAmountRequired`.

### Stellar

- Facilitator safety: the facilitator's address MUST NOT appear as transaction source, operation source, transfer `from` address, or in authorization entries.
- Authorization integrity: auth entries MUST use `sorobanCredentialsAddress` only, MUST NOT contain sub-invocations, and expiration MUST NOT exceed `currentLedger + ceil(maxTimeoutSeconds / estimatedLedgerSeconds)` (fallback to `5` seconds).
- Transfer correctness: `to` MUST equal `payTo` and `amount` MUST equal `requirements.amount` exactly.
- Simulation verification: MUST emit events showing only the expected balance changes (recipient increase, payer decrease) for `requirements.amount`—no other balance changes allowed.

### Hive

- Transaction structure: the signed transaction MUST contain exactly one `transfer` operation.
- Recipient correctness: `transfer.to` MUST equal `paymentRequirements.payTo`.
- Amount correctness: the transferred HBD amount MUST be ≥ `maxAmountRequired`.
- Signature verification: the recovered public key MUST match an active key authority of the `transfer.from` account on-chain.
- Zero-cost safety: Hive transactions have no fees, so the Facilitator incurs no cost and cannot be tricked into spending its own funds. The Facilitator MUST NOT modify any field of the signed transaction before broadcasting.

Network-specific rules are in per-network documents: `scheme_exact_svm.md` (Solana), `scheme_exact_stellar.md` (Stellar), `scheme_exact_evm.md` (EVM), `scheme_exact_sui.md` (SUI), `scheme_exact_hive.md` (Hive).
