# Scheme: `exact` on `EVM`

## Summary

The `exact` scheme on EVM executes a transfer where the Facilitator (server) pays the gas, but the Client (user) controls the exact flow of funds via cryptographic signatures.

This is implemented via one of two asset transfer methods, depending on the token's capabilities:

| AssetTransferMethod | Use Case                                                     | Recommendation                                 |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **1. EIP-3009**     | Tokens with native `transferWithAuthorization` (e.g., USDC). | **Recommended** (Simplest, truly gasless).     |
| **2. Permit2**      | Tokens without EIP-3009. Uses a Proxy + Permit2.             | **Universal Fallback** (Works for any ERC-20). |
| **3. ERC-7710**      | Smart accounts with delegation support.                              | **Smart Account Option** (Requires ERC-7710 compatible account). |

If no `assetTransferMethod` is specified in the payload, the implementation should prioritize `eip3009` (if compatible) and then `permit2`.

In all cases, the Facilitator cannot modify the amount or destination. They serve only as the transaction broadcaster.

---

## 1. AssetTransferMethod: `EIP-3009`

The `eip3009` asset transfer method uses the `transferWithAuthorization` function directly on token contracts that support it.

### Phase 1: `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` Header Payload

The `payload` field must contain:

- `signature`: The 65-byte signature of the `transferWithAuthorization` operation.
- `authorization`: The parameters required to reconstruct the signed message.

**Example PaymentPayload:**

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "resource": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/premium-data",
    "description": "Access to premium market data",
    "mimeType": "application/json"
  },
  "accepted": {
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "eip155:84532",
    "amount": "10000",
    "asset": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",
    "payTo": "0x209693Bc6afc0C5328bA36FaF03C514EF312287C",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
    "extra": {
      "assetTransferMethod": "eip3009",
      "name": "USDC",
      "version": "2"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "signature": "0x2d6a7588d6acca505cbf0d9a4a227e0c52c6c34008c8e8986a1283259764173608a2ce6496642e377d6da8dbbf5836e9bd15092f9ecab05ded3d6293af148b571c",
    "authorization": {
      "from": "0x857b06519E91e3A54538791bDbb0E22373e36b66",
      "to": "0x209693Bc6afc0C5328bA36FaF03C514EF312287C",
      "value": "10000",
      "validAfter": "1740672089",
      "validBefore": "1740672154",
      "nonce": "0xf3746613c2d920b5fdabc0856f2aeb2d4f88ee6037b8cc5d04a71a4462f13480"
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Verification Logic

1.  **Verify** the signature is valid and recovers to the `authorization.from` address.
2.  **Verify** the `client` has sufficient balance of the `asset`.
3.  **Verify** the authorization parameters (Amount, Validity Window) meet the `PaymentRequirements`.
4.  **Verify** the Token and Network match the requirement.
5.  **Simulate** `token.transferWithAuthorization(...)` to ensure success.

### Phase 3: Settlement Logic

Settlement is performed via the facilitator calling the `transferWithAuthorization` function on the `EIP-3009` compliant contract with the `payload.signature` and `payload.authorization` parameters from the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header.

---

## 2. AssetTransferMethod: `Permit2`

This asset transfer method uses the `permitWitnessTransferFrom` from the [canonical **Permit2** contract](#canonical-permit2) combined with a [`x402Permit2Proxy`](#reference-implementation-x402permit2proxy) to enforce receiver address security via the "Witness" pattern.

### Phase 1: One-Time Gas Approval

Permit2 requires the user to approve the [**Permit2 Contract** (Canonical Address)](#canonical-permit2) to spend their tokens. This is a one-time setup. The specification supports three ways to handle this:

#### Option A: Direct User Approval (Standard)

The user submits a standard on-chain `approve(Permit2)` transaction paying their own gas.

- _Prerequisite:_ User must have Native Gas currency.

#### Option B: Sponsored ERC20 Approval (Extension: [`erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring`](../../extensions/erc20_gas_sponsoring.md))

The Facilitator pays the gas for the approval transaction on the user's behalf.

- _Prerequisite:_ Server supports this extension.
- _Flow:_ Facilitator batches the following transactions: `from.transfer(gas_amount)` -> `ERC20.approve(Permit2)` -> `settle`.

#### Option C: EIP2612 Permit (Extension: [`eip2612GasSponsoring`](../../extensions/eip2612_gas_sponsoring.md))

If the token supports EIP-2612, the user signs a permit authorizing Permit2.

- _Prerequisite:_ Token supports EIP-2612.
- _Flow:_ Facilitator calls `x402Permit2Proxy.settleWithPermit()`

### Phase 2: `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` Header Payload

The `payload` field must contain:

- `signature`: The signature for `permitWitnessTransferFrom`.
- `permit2Authorization`: Parameters to reconstruct the message.

**Important Logic:** The `spender` in the signature is the [**x402Permit2Proxy**](#reference-implementation-x402permit2proxy), not the Facilitator. This Proxy enforces that funds are only sent to the `witness.to` address.

> **Requirement**: This contract will be deployed to the same address across all supported EVM chains using `CREATE2` to ensure consistent behavior and simpler integration.

**Example PaymentPayload:**

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "accepted": {
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "eip155:84532",
    "amount": "10000",
    "payTo": "0x209693Bc6afc0C5328bA36FaF03C514EF312287C",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
    "asset": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",
    "extra": {
      "assetTransferMethod": "permit2",
      "name": "USDC",
      "version": "2"
    }
  }
  "payload": {
    "signature": "0x2d6a7588d6acca505cbf0d9a4a227e0c52c6c34008c8e8986a1283259764173608a2ce6496642e377d6da8dbbf5836e9bd15092f9ecab05ded3d6293af148b571c",
    "permit2Authorization": {
      "permitted": {
        "token": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",
        "amount": "10000"
      },
      "from": "0x857b06519E91e3A54538791bDbb0E22373e36b66",
      "spender": "0xx402Permit2ProxyAddress",
      "nonce": "0xf3746613c2d920b5fdabc0856f2aeb2d4f88ee6037b8cc5d04a71a4462f13480",
      "deadline": "1740672154",
      "witness": {
        "to": "0x209693Bc6afc0C5328bA36FaF03C514EF312287C",
        "validAfter": "1740672089",
        "extra": {}
      }
    }
  },
}
```

### Phase 3: Verification Logic

The verifier must execute these checks in order:

1.  **Verify** `payload.signature` is valid and recovers to the `permit2Authorization.from`.

    - Note that `extra` must be converted to its ABI encoded version.

2.  **Verify** that the `client` has enabled the Permit2 approval.

    - if ERC20.allowance(from, Permit2_Address) < amount:
      - Check for **Sponsored ERC20 Approval** (Extension): Refers to [`erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring`](../../extensions/erc20_gas_sponsoring.md).
      - Check for **EIP2612 Permit** (Extension): Refers to [`eip2612GasSponsoring`](../../extensions/eip2612_gas_sponsoring.md).
      - **If neither exists:** Return `412 Precondition Failed` (Error Code: `PERMIT2_ALLOWANCE_REQUIRED`). This signals the client that a one-time Direct Approval transaction is required before retrying.

3.  **Verify** the `client` has sufficient balance of the `asset`.

4.  **Verify** the `permit2Authorization.amount` covers the payment.

5.  **Verify** the `deadline` (not expired) and `witness.validAfter` (active).

6.  **Verify** the Token and Network match the requirement.

7.  **Simulation:**

    - _Standard:_ Simulate `x402Permit2Proxy.settle`.
    - _With "Sponsored ERC20 Approval" (Extension):_ Simulate batch `transfer` -> `approve` -> `settle`.
    - _With "EIP2612 Permit" (Extension):_ Simulate `x402Permit2Proxy.settleWithPermit`.

### Phase 4: Settlement Logic

Settlement is performed by calling the `x402Permit2Proxy`.

1.  **Standard Settlement:**
    If the user has a sufficient direct allowance, call `x402Permit2Proxy.settle`.

2.  **With Sponsored ERC20 Approval (Extension):**
    If `erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring` is used, the facilitator must construct a batched transaction that executes the sponsored `ERC20.approve` call strictly before the `x402Permit2Proxy.settle` call.

3.  **With EIP-2612 Permit (Extension):**
    If `eip2612GasSponsoring` is used, call `x402Permit2Proxy.settleWithPermit`.

---

## 3. AssetTransferMethod: `ERC-7710`

This asset transfer method uses [ERC-7710](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7710) smart contract delegation to authorize transfers from accounts that support the standard. It is particularly suited for smart contract accounts (e.g., ERC-4337 accounts, ERC-7579 modular accounts) that have enabled delegation capabilities.

### Prerequisites

For ERC-7710 to work, the following must be true:

1. **Delegator Account**: The payer's account must be a smart contract that supports ERC-7710 delegation (e.g., a modular smart account with delegation capabilities).
2. **Delegation Manager**: A `DelegationManager` contract implementing the `ERC7710Manager` interface must be deployed on the network.
3. **Active Delegation**: The payer must have created a delegation authorizing the delegate to execute token transfers on their behalf, with appropriate caveats (amount limits, recipient restrictions, etc.).

### Phase 1: Obtaining a Delegation

The process of obtaining a delegation is outside the scope of x402. Delegations may be obtained through:

- [ERC-7715](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7715) permission requests
- Direct wallet interactions
- Pre-configured session keys
- Other delegation protocols

The key requirement is that the delegate (typically the x402 client or facilitator) holds a valid delegation that permits the required token transfer.

### Phase 2: `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` Header Payload

The `payload` field must contain:

- `delegationManager`: The address of the ERC-7710 Delegation Manager contract.
- `permissionContext`: The delegation proof/context required by the specific Delegation Manager implementation.
- `mode`: The ERC-7579 execution mode (typically single call mode: `0x0000...`).
- `executionCallData`: The encoded execution data for the token transfer.

**Example PaymentPayload:**

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "resource": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/premium-data",
    "description": "Access to premium market data",
    "mimeType": "application/json"
  },
  "accepted": {
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "eip155:84532",
    "amount": "10000",
    "asset": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",
    "payTo": "0x209693Bc6afc0C5328bA36FaF03C514EF312287C",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
    "extra": {
      "assetTransferMethod": "erc7710",
      "name": "USDC",
      "version": "2"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "delegationManager": "0xDelegationManagerAddress",
    "permissionContext": "0x...",
    "mode": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "executionCallData": "0x...",
    "delegator": "0x857b06519E91e3A54538791bDbb0E22373e36b66"
  }
}
```

**Note:** The structure of `permissionContext` is determined by the specific Delegation Manager implementation. Common implementations (e.g., MetaMask Delegation Framework) use EIP-712 signed delegation chains.

### Phase 3: Verification Logic

The verifier must execute these checks in order:

1. **Verify** the `delegationManager` is a known, trusted ERC-7710 implementation.

2. **Verify** the `delegator` account supports ERC-7710 (is a compatible smart account).

3. **Verify** the `client` (delegator) has sufficient balance of the `asset`.

4. **Verify** the `executionCallData` encodes a valid ERC-20 `transfer(to, amount)` call where:
   - `to` matches the `payTo` address in the payment requirements.
   - `amount` covers the required payment amount.

5. **Verify** the `mode` is appropriate for a single token transfer (typically `0x00...` for single call mode per ERC-7579).

6. **Verify** the Token and Network match the requirement.

7. **Simulation**: Simulate `delegationManager.redeemDelegations([permissionContext], [mode], [executionCallData])` to ensure the delegation is valid and the transfer will succeed.

### Phase 4: Settlement Logic

Settlement is performed by calling `redeemDelegations` on the Delegation Manager:

```solidity
delegationManager.redeemDelegations(
    [permissionContext],  // bytes[] - delegation proof
    [mode],               // bytes32[] - execution mode
    [executionCallData]   // bytes[] - encoded transfer call
);
```

The Delegation Manager validates the delegation authority and calls the delegator account to execute the token transfer. The delegator account then performs `token.transfer(payTo, amount)`.

**Important**: Unlike EIP-3009 and Permit2, the facilitator does NOT need to be explicitly authorized in the signature. The delegation's caveats (enforced by the Delegation Manager) ensure that:
- Only authorized actions can be executed
- Transfer recipients are constrained to allowed addresses
- Amounts are within permitted limits

---

## Annex

### ERC-7710 Delegation Managers

ERC-7710 does not define a canonical Delegation Manager. Implementations may vary in their delegation structure, caveat enforcement, and permission context format. Notable implementations include:

- **MetaMask Delegation Framework**: A full-featured implementation supporting EIP-712 signed delegation chains, caveat enforcement, and batch processing. See [delegator.xyz](https://delegator.xyz/) for documentation.

When using ERC-7710, facilitators should maintain a list of trusted Delegation Manager addresses for each supported network.

### Canonical Permit2

The Canonical Permit2 contract address can be found at [https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/deployments](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/deployments).

### Reference Implementation: `x402Permit2Proxy`

This contract acts as the authorized Spender. It validates the Witness data to ensure the destination cannot be altered by the Facilitator.

> **Requirement**: This contract will be deployed to the same address across all supported EVM chains using `CREATE2` to ensure consistent behavior and simpler integration.
