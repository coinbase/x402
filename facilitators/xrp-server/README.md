## 📝 Payment Flow

1. **Client** creates XRP payment transaction
2. **Client** sends payment to resource server with X-PAYMENT header
3. **Resource Server** calls facilitator `/verify` endpoint
4. **Facilitator** validates transaction structure and requirements
5. **Resource Server** provides service if verification passes
6. **Resource Server** calls facilitator `/settle` endpoint
7. **Facilitator** submits transaction to XRP Ledger
8. **Client** receives service response
