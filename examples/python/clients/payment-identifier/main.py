"""Payment-Identifier Extension Client Example.

Demonstrates how to use the payment-identifier extension to enable idempotency
when making payments. This allows safe retries without duplicate payments.

This example:
1. Makes a request with a unique payment ID
2. Makes a second request with the SAME payment ID
3. The second request returns from cache without payment processing

Required environment variables:
- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of the EVM signer
